## Projects

### Deep Learning Framework From Scratch
I developed a deep learning framework from scratch, first building a scalar-based autograd engine to understand the fundamental mechanics of backpropagation and computational graphs, inspired by Andrej Karpathy. I then scaled the project by creating a more efficient, tensor-based system that leveraged matrix calculus and optimized operations. This project, demonstrates my expertise in low-level AI implementation, including handling complex challenges like broadcasting and gradient reduction. By comparing the performance of both systems, I was able to show a dramatic speedup from scalar to tensor operations, solidifying my understanding of the core mathematical principles and architectural optimizations that power modern deep learning.

### Paper Trading App
I developed a web-based Paper Trading Application using Flask, which provides users with a comprehensive platform for managing a simulated stock portfolio. This project integrates real-time stock market data with a pre-trained LSTM model to generate AI-powered price predictions, allowing users to buy and sell stocks, track their portfolio performance, and view their transaction history.

### Workout Tracker
I developed a real-time Workout Tracker that uses OpenCV and a machine learning model to count repetitions for various exercises. Users can train the model by providing reference images of an exercise's contracted and extended positions, which enables the application to accurately track their reps live via a webcam. This project also features a custom SQL database to log workout history and a built-in timer, demonstrating my expertise in computer vision and Scikit-Learn.

### Spam Detection ML Model
I developed a spam detector in Python using a pipeline of custom transformers to preprocess email text and build a logistic regression model. This project demonstrates my skills in NLP, starting with a transformer for text cleaning and feature engineering, followed by the transformer to vectorize the data.

This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :
